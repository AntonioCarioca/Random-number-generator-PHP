# Introduction

>There are various use cases for a Random Number Generator. You could do a random dice roll or get a random quote. Most of the time, the implementation is relatively straightforward and similar to this projectâ€™s approach. In this project, we will create a dice roll simulation.

# Requirements

>The RNG should consist of:
>
* An input box to assign how many dice to roll
* A drop down box to select the sides of the dice (for example d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)
* A PHP rand(); function taking the inputs from the form
* An output to show # of dice rolled, the type of dice (d4, d6 ..), the total count of the dices rolled
* Output the details (number) of the individual dice rolls (Possibly using a foreach loop)

# Suggested Implementation

>PHP is a server-side language, which means we need to use either a local web server (Free) or a web hosting package (Low cost) to run the code.
>
* The majority of the functionality will be passed with PHP, HTML will allow us to create the form and the webpage structure, and CSS will give us the ability to style the HTML.Server: Local web server such as XAMPP or WAMP OR Web hosting
* Basic PHP knowledge of using variables and POST content.
* Using simple PHP functions such as rand();
* Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS to create forms
